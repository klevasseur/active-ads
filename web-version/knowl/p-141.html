<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Read sections 3.3 and 3.4 of Applied Discrete Structures. Two propositions may be totally unrelated.  For example, “It snowed today.” and “I played chess today.” are likely to be unrelated.  Yet “It snowed today.” and “I played golf today.” are two propositions that are related in that it is unlikely that both are true.  In these two sections we introduce the ideas of equivalence and implication, which give us a precise way to talk about how propositions are related.</p>
