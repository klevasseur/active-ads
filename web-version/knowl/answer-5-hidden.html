<li><p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Clearly the longest distance between pairs of desks is \(4+6= 10\text{.}\) The shortest longest distance from any desk is 5, which is the distance from the desk in the middle of the room, the fourth desk in row 3.  There are vertices with eccentricities for all integers between 5 and 10.  The radius is 5 and the diameter is 10.   The center contains only one desk, the middle one.</p></li>
<li><p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">If an adjacency matrix is constructed for this graph with one bit (0/1) for each entry, how many bits would be needed?  Assume we only store the part of the matrix that appears to the top right of the main diagonal of the matrix since its symmetric.</p></li>
<li><p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">If an edge dictionary is used in which eight bits are used for each vertex number and eight bits for each entry in the list of adjacent vertices, how many bits would be needed? Assume that if \(i\) appears in the list of neighbors of \(j\text{,}\) then we don't need to list \(j\) in the list of neighbors of \(i\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">If a list of ordered pairs is used, where each pair requires 16 bit, how many bits would be needed?  Assume that for any two vertices, \(i\) and \(j\text{,}\) only one of the pairs \((i,j)\) and \((j,i)\) need to be listed.</p></li>
