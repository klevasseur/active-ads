<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Earlier, we proved that with supplies of five and eight cent stamps, we could make any postage amount of 28 cents or more.  Here, we will look at what smaller amounts can and can't be made.  Let \(F(z)= \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} (z^{5})^n\) and \(E(z)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} (z^{8})^n\text{.}\)  Every combination of stamps corresponds with the product of one term from \(F(z)\) with one term from \(E(z)\text{.}\)  For example, the product \((z^{5})^{2}\cdot (z^{8})^1= z^{18}\)  corresponds with combining two five cent stamps and one eight cent stamp.  Compute the first few terms of \(F(z)\cdot E(z)\) to  get all terms with degree less than 28. The terms that are missing (have a coefficient of zero) are the ones that correspond with amounts that can't be created.  In general, the coefficient of \(z^n\) in the product will be the number of ways that \(n\) cents can be made. Do a similar calculation to identify the amounts that cannot created with 7 and 9 cent stamps.</p>
