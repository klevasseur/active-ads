<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Halfway into testing Part 1 of this document, the Covid-19 pandemic forced my class online. The transition wasn't perfect, but by using Zoom and Piazza I managed to approximate the face-to-face experience to some degree.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">After answering questions and a short introduction to the topic of the day, I distributed students into breakout rooms in Zoom.  The groups worked on the in-class problems and posted their solutions on Piazza.  Within a corresponding Piazza group, they would post the answer to on of the questions.  I could monitor each group's Piazza posts in real time, commenting on or endorsing the solutions.  If needed, I could also drop in on the group's breakout room to help out with any difficulties. Students were brought back to the main room for the final 15 minutes or so to review the solutions that were found by the groups.  Finally, I would pin correct solutions and make them available to the whole class as a record of the work done that day. This final step added value over what we would do in the face-to-face meetings.</p></section><span class="incontext"><a href="active-ads-preface.html#paragraphs-5">in-context</a></span>
