<p>Consider the set of lattice paths from \((0,0)\) to \((8,8)\text{.}\)  You should know one quick formula for the cardinality of that set.  However, counting a different way can lead to an interesting  identity involving binomial coefficients.  Notice that any path goes through exactly one of the points \((0,8), (1,7), (2,6), \dots , (8,0)\text{.}\)  Count the number of lattice paths that go through each of those 9 points - leave the expression in terms of binomial coefficients.  Even more interesting is what you get if  generalize to a destination of \((n,n)\text{,}\) \(n \geq 1\text{.}\)</p></article>
