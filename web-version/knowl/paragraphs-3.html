<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Each chapter has two or three sections.  Each chapter except the first has a reading section that contains instructions to student prior the class period. Generally, this is to read one or more sections of the text, respond to a “Response Question” and do a few basic problems associated with the reading.  The Response Questions tend to be more tangential to the content and often connect the mathematics to computer science.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">The second section is always a series of problems to be worked on during the class. For students' convenience, some chapters have a third section, usually containing a short excerpt from <em class="emphasis">Applied Discrete Structures</em>.</p></section><span class="incontext"><a href="active-ads-preface.html#paragraphs-3">in-context</a></span>
