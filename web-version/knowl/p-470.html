<p>A classroom has 5 rows of desks, with 7 desks in each row.   Suppose we want to represent this rectangular arrangement of desks in an undirected graph, where each desk is connected to the neighboring desks to it's front, back, left and right.  Of course, some desks have fewer than four neighbors.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">How many edges will the graph have?</p></li>
<li><p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Determine the possible eccentricities of vertices in this graph. What is the diameter, radius and center of the graph.</p></li>
<li><p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">If an adjacency matrix is constructed for this graph with one bit (0/1) for each entry, how many bits would be needed?  Assume we only store the part of the matrix that appears to the top right of the main diagonal of the matrix since its symmetric.</p></li>
<li><p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">If an edge dictionary is used in which eight bits are used for each vertex number and eight bits for each entry in the list of adjacent vertices, how many bits would be needed? Assume that if \(i\) appears in the list of neighbors of \(j\text{,}\) then we don't need to list \(j\) in the list of neighbors of \(i\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">If a list of ordered pairs is used, where each pair requires 16 bit, how many bits would be needed?  Assume that for any two vertices, \(i\) and \(j\text{,}\) only one of the pairs \((i,j)\) and \((j,i)\) need to be listed.</p></li>
