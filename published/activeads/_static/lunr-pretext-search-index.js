  "body": "Preface   Introduction  Active Applied Discrete Structures is designed for use in a flipped class using Applied Discrete Structures . Each chapter, designed for a 75 minute class period. There are two parts that correspond with a two semester sequence, Part 1 - Fundamentals , and Part 2 - Structures .    Usage  The class format that is presumed is for the instructor to assign students to read materials that will be covered in class in time for students to submit a short assignment by the beginning of class . Then, at the time of class , they work on more challenging problems in groups of 4-6 students.  A tricky thing about this format is getting started. On class 1 of the first semester, no prior reading can be expected. The binary representation of positive integers is discussed. This is mostly done through group work. The assumption is that since most students in the class are computer science majors, they have some familiarity with the topic and can help other students with the problems. Class 2 is also a bit of a rush. I ask students to do reading for that class and get responses back to me a couple of days before the second class. They are also asked to prepare for Class 3 and get responses to me by Class 2. Fortunately, the material in Chapter 1 isn't too difficult. The rest of the semester proceeds as described above. In the second semester, the first class is taken up by reviewing the most important concepts from the first semester through sequence of problems. Another quick turn-around in the reading for Class 2 is needed to get into the flow. After that the second semester proceeds the same as the first.    Contents of the Chapters  Each chapter has two or three sections. Each chapter except the first has a reading section that contains instructions to student prior the class period. Generally, this is to read one or more sections of the text, respond to a Response Question and do a few basic problems associated with the reading. The Response Questions tend to be more tangential to the content and often connect the mathematics to computer science.  The second section is always a series of problems to be worked on during the class. For students' convenience, some chapters have a third section, usually containing a short excerpt from Applied Discrete Structures .    The Problems  The problems and ideas that make up this work come from several sources. Many of the problems are taken directly from Applied Discrete Structures , mostly even numbered problems for which no solutions are published. In some cases, the problem are slightly altered. I've also mined problems from other sources. Some were clearly in the public domain in that they have appeared in several places over many years. In those cases, I haven't identified the source. There have been a few problems or ideas that seemed somewhat more novel, and I've noted their source. Books by Bogart ( ) and Levin ( ) are among these sources.  I've attempted to mix relatively easy problems with some more challenging ones for in-class work, while keeping the number of problems doable for most of the students.    Technology - Zoom and Piazza  Halfway into testing Part 1 of this document, the Covid-19 pandemic forced my class online. The transition wasn't perfect, but by using Zoom and Piazza I managed to approximate the face-to-face experience to some degree.  After answering questions and a short introduction to the topic of the day, I distributed students into breakout rooms in Zoom. The groups worked on the in-class problems and posted their solutions on Piazza. Within a corresponding Piazza group, they would post the answer to on of the questions. I could monitor each group's Piazza posts in real time, commenting on or endorsing the solutions. If needed, I could also drop in on the group's breakout room to help out with any difficulties. Students were brought back to the main room for the final 15 minutes or so to review the solutions that were found by the groups. Finally, I would pin correct solutions and make them available to the whole class as a record of the work done that day. This final step added value over what we would do in the face-to-face meetings.    Status  As of the spring of 2020, Part 1 - Fundamentals , contains 24 chapters class-tested in the first semester course at UMass Lowell. This covers the first eight chapters of Applied Discrete Structures . Part 2 - Structures will contain another 24 chapters for use in a second semester course.   The main web page for Applied Discrete Structures is    Ken Levasseur  Lowell, MA   "

Suppose an undirected planar graph has the following properties: All vertices have degree three (this called a cubic graph )  All faces of the graph's planar embedding are hexagons and pentagons; i. e, they is made up of either five or six edges. What can be said about the numbers of hexagons and pentagons in the graph? There must be 12 pentagons. The number of hexagons cannot be determined.  A teacher decides to have their students grade one another's quizzes. The scheme that is devised is that when a bell is rung, each student is to immediately pass their quiz to a classmate either to the front, back, right or left of themselves.

It is not possible to arrange grading as described. If you color the desks in the class like a checkerboard, alternating black and white desks, there will be more of one color, say white, than black. Every white desk has to pass their paper to a different black desk, but that's impossible because there aren't enough black desks.  chromatic polynomial of a graph The chromatic polynomial of a graph, is a polynomial such that for each positive integer , equals the number of different ways you can color with colors.

How are the chromatic number and the chromatic polynomial of a graph related?   The chromatic polynomial of a is . This follows from the fact that each vertex must be colored differently.  The chromatic polynomial of a is a bit more difficult to determine. If we number the vertices 1 through 4 and start be coloring vertex 1, it can colored ways. Then going around a cycle of any length we color the next vertex so as to differ from the previous one. However we run into a problem when we reach the last two vertices before reaching the start of the cycle. For the -cycle, vertex 1 can be colored ways and vertex 2 can be colored ways.

If they differ in color, then there are ways to color vertex 3, and then ways to finish up coloring vertex 4. Therefore the chromatic polynomial is .  The chromatic polynomial of a is . One way to derive this is as follows. We partition the possible ways to color the left side of the graph according to how many different colors are used. It's possible to use the same color for all vertices, two colors for them or three different colors. If the same color is used on the left, there are ways to do that, and then ways to color the right. If there are two colors used on the left, there are three ways to select the vertex that has a unique color and then there are ways to select the two colors. This second possible scheme is finished by coloring the right side in one of ways. Finally, if all three of the left side vertices are colored differently, this can be done ways and the right side can then be colored in one of ways.

Partial orderings were introduced in Chapter 6 and you might want to review the definition before you start on Chapter 13. You might recall that partial orderings tend to compare certain pairs of elements in a poset according to some size, where size might not always mean size in the conventional sense. In any case, if we take two elements from a poset, an upper bound is something in the poset that is comparably larger than them both. A lower bound is defined similarly. In some cases, we can define binary operations ( join and meet ) based on this idea. When we can, we get an algebraic structure called a lattice .

With this code, can you detect single bit errors? Can you correct all, some, or no single bit errors?    Rectangular Code To build a rectangular code , you partition your message into blocks of length and then factor into and arrange the bits in a rectangular array as in the figure below. Then you add parity bits along the right side and bottom of the rows and columns. The code word is then read row by row.   For example, if is 4, then our only choice is a 2 by 2 array. The message 1101 would be encoded as and the code word is the string 11001110.    Suppose that you were sent four bit messages using this code and you received the following strings.
