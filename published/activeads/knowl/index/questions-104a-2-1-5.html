<li><div class="para">The chromatic polynomial of a <span class="process-math">\(K_4\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(x(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)\text{.}\)</span> This follows from the fact that each vertex must be colored differently.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">The chromatic polynomial of a <span class="process-math">\(C_4\)</span> is a bit more difficult to determine.   If we number the vertices 1 through 4 and start be coloring vertex 1, it can colored <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> ways.  Then going around a cycle of any length we color the next vertex so as to differ from the previous one.  However we run into a problem when we reach the last two vertices before reaching the start of the cycle.  For the <span class="process-math">\(4\)</span>-cycle, vertex 1 can be colored <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> ways and vertex 2 can be colored <span class="process-math">\(x-1\)</span> ways. We need to to partition the possibilities according to whether vertex 3 has the same color as vertex 1 or a different color.  If they have the same color, then there are <span class="process-math">\(x-1\)</span> ways to color vertex 4.  If they differ in color, then there are <span class="process-math">\(x-2\)</span> ways to color vertex 3, and then <span class="process-math">\(x-2\)</span> ways to finish up coloring vertex 4. Therefore the chromatic polynomial is <span class="process-math">\(x(x-1)((x-1)+(x-2)^2)= x(x-1)(x^2-3x+3)\text{.}\)</span>

<li><div class="para logical">
<div class="para">The chromatic polynomial of a <span class="process-math">\(K_{3,3}\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(x^6-9 x^5+36 x^4-75 x^3+78 x^2-31 x\text{.}\)</span> One way to derive this is as follows. We partition the possible ways to color the “left side” of the graph according to how many different colors are used.  It’s possible to use the same color for all vertices, two colors for them or three different colors.  If the same color is used on the left, there are <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> ways to do that, and then <span class="process-math">\((x-1)^3\)</span> ways to color the right. If there are two colors used on the left, there are three ways to select the vertex that has a unique color and then there are <span class="process-math">\(x(x-1)\)</span> ways to select the two colors. This second possible scheme is finished by coloring the right side in one of  <span class="process-math">\((x-2)^3\)</span> ways.  Finally, if all three of the left side vertices are colored differently, this can be done <span class="process-math">\(x(x-1)(x-2)\)</span> ways and the right side can then be colored in one of <span class="process-math">\((x-3)^3\)</span> ways.  To sum up the total number of ways to color our graph is</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
x (x-1)^3  +3x (x-1) (x-2)^3 + x (x-1) (x-2) (x-3)^3= x^6-9 x^5+36 x^4-75 x^3+78 x^2-31 x

<li><div class="para">The chromatic number is the least positive integer <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> such that the chromatic polynomial evaluated at <span class="process-math">\(x=n\)</span> is nonzero.  For example, the chomatic polynomial of the <span class="process-math">\(K_{3,3}\)</span> is zero when <span class="process-math">\(x=0\text{,}\)</span> but its value when <span class="process-math">\(x=2\)</span> is 2, which is consistant with the fact that a <span class="process-math">\(K_{3,3}\)</span> is bipartite.</div></li>
