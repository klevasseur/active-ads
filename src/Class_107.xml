<p>Read Section 11.1 of <em>Applied Discrete Structures</em>. This is the beginning of a new topic, but you'll find that there are connections between algebra and graph theory.   In this first section we review properties of binary operations.</p>
<question><title>Response Question</title><statement><p>True or False?  Multiplication is an associative operation on the set <m>\{-1,1\}</m>.  Justify your answer.</p></statement></question>
<p>Also, turn in solutions to these exercises:</p>

		<exercise>
		<statement><p>Consider the  operation <m>\square</m> on the  integers defined by  <me>a \square b  = a+b-1.</me>  
	<ol marker="(a)">
		<li><p> Is <m>\square</m> associative?</p></li>
		<li><p>Does  <m>\square</m> have an identity in the positive integers?</p></li>
		<li><p> Does  <m>\square</m> have the inverse property?</p></li>
		</ol></p>
		</statement>
		<solution><p>
		<ol marker="(a)">
		<li><p>Yes, it is associative: 
		<md>
		<mrow>(a \square b)\square c= (a+b-1)\square c = a+b-1+c-1 = a+b+c-2</mrow>
		<mrow>a \square(b \square c)= a \square(b+c-1) = a+(b+c-1)-1 = a+b+c-2</mrow></md></p></li>
		<li><p>If <m>e</m> is an identity,  we would need <m>a \square e=a+e-1 = a.</m>  Solving <m>a+e-1 = a</m> for <m>e</m>, we see that 1 is an identity. </p></li>
		<li><p>No, the inverse of a postitive integer <m>a</m>  would be <m>b</m>   such that <m>a \square b=1</m>.   Therefore <m>a+b-1=1</m>, or <m>b=-a+2</m>.  But since we assume <m>a</m> is a positive integer <m>b</m> is not positive unless <m>a = 1</m>,  and so only 1 have an inverse.</p></li>

		<exercise><statement><p>This question is open-ended, with no specific <q>right</q> answer.  Suppose that <m>V</m> is some finite nonempty set. What would be an example of a binary operation on the set of all undirected graphs with vertex set<m>V</m>?</p>
