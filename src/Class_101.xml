<title>Start of Second Semeser, Review</title>
<introduction><p>In the first class of the second semester, some time will be taken to review the course format and syllabus.  In the remaining time, work on problems that review some of the fundamental concepts from the first semester.</p></introduction>

<exercise><statement><p>Let <m>V=\{1,2,\dots,n\}</m> where <m>n</m> is some positive integer greater than 1. 
<ol>
<li><p> How many two element subsets are there of <m>V</m>?</p></li>
<li><p>   What is the cardinality of <m>V\times V</m>?</p></li>
<li><p> Are <m>\{1,2\}</m> and <m>\{2,1\}</m> equal?</p></li>
<li><p>  Are <m>\{1,2\}</m> and <m>(1,2)</m> equal?</p></li>
<li><p>Are <m>(1,2)</m> and <m>(2,1)</m> equal?</p></li>
<li><p>If <m>n=4</m> and we define the relation <m>\asymp</m> by <m>(a,b)\asymp (c,d)</m> if and only if <m>a+b=c+d</m>.  What are the equivalence classes defined by <m>\asymp</m>? </p></li>

<exercise><statement><p>Prove that if <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> are one-to-one functions on a set <m>X</m>, then <m>g \circ f</m> is also a one-to-one function on <m>X</m>. Note: You might be more familiar with the term <em>injection</em> or <em>injective function</em> for a one-to-one function.  They all mean the same thing.</p></statement></exercise>

<exercise><statement><p>Partition the set <m>X=\{k \in \mathbb{Z} \mid  -10 \leq k \leq 10\}</m> into equivalence classes according to the relation congruence modulo 4, <m>\equiv_4</m>.</p></statement></exercise>

<!-- 
<exercise><statement><p>Is the following logical argument valid?  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    Peacham is either in Vermont or New Hampshire. If Peacham is in Vermont, then Peacham is in New England. If Peacham is in New Hamphire, then Peacham is in New England. Therefore, Peacham is in New England.</p>
</blockquote>
</statement><answer component="im"><p>Yes, this argument is valid.  Symbolically, it is 
	<me>V \lor NH, V\rightarrow NE, NH\rightarrow NE \Rightarrow NE</me>
which can be proven correct. </p></answer></exercise>

<exercise><statement><p>
        Prove, by mathematical induction, that <m>F_0 + F_1 + F_2 + \cdots + F_{n} = F_{n+2} - 1</m>,
        where <m>F_n</m> is the <m>n</m>th number in the

<exercise><statement><p>Prove that if <m>n</m> is an integer and you divide <m>n^2</m> by 5, then the remainder is always 0, 1, or 4.</p></statement></exercise>

<exercise><statement><p>Prove that the square root of 5 is an irrational number.</p></statement></exercise>

<exercise><statement><p>Solve the recurrence relation <m>e_n=2 e_{n-1}+2^{n-1}</m> with initial condition <m>e_1 = 1</m>. Recall that solving a recurrence relation means finding  closed form expression for the sequence it defines.</p></statement>
