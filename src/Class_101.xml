<ol label="1.">
<li><p>Prove that if <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> are bijections on a set <m>X</m>, then <m>g \circ f</m> is also a bijection on <m>X</m>. </p></li>
<li><p>Partition the set <m>X=\{k \in \mathbb{Z} \mid  -10 \leq k \leq 10\}</m> into equivalence classes according to the relation congruence modulo 4, <m>\equiv_4</m>.</p></li>
<li><p>Is the following logical argument valid?  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    Peacham is either in Vermont or New Hampshire. If Peacham is in Vermont, then Peacham is in New England. If Peacham is in New Hamphire, then Peacham is in New England. Therefore, Peacham is in New England.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>
        Prove, by mathematical induction, that <m>F_0 + F_1 + F_2 + \cdots + F_{n} = F_{n+2} - 1</m>,
        where <m>F_n</m> is the <m>n</m>th Fibonacci number (<m>F_0 = 1</m>,
        <m>F_1 = 1</m> and <m>F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}</m> for <m>n\geq 2</m>).
    </p>
</li>
<li><p>Prove that if <m>n</m> is an integer and you divide <m>n^2</m> by 5, then the remainder is always 0, 1, or 4.</p></li>
<li><p>Prove that the square root of 5 is an irrational number.</p></li>
