<exercise><statement><p>Prove that if <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> are bijections on a set <m>X</m>, then <m>g \circ f</m> is also a bijection on <m>X</m>. </p></statement></exercise>

<exercise><statement><p>Partition the set <m>X=\{k \in \mathbb{Z} \mid  -10 \leq k \leq 10\}</m> into equivalence classes according to the relation congruence modulo 4, <m>\equiv_4</m>.</p></statement></exercise>

<exercise><statement><p>Is the following logical argument valid?  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    Peacham is either in Vermont or New Hampshire. If Peacham is in Vermont, then Peacham is in New England. If Peacham is in New Hamphire, then Peacham is in New England. Therefore, Peacham is in New England.</p>
</blockquote>
</statement><answer><p>Yes, this argument is valid.  Symbolically, it is 
	<me>V \lor NH, V\rightarrow NE, NH\rightarrow NE \Rightarrow NE</me>
which can be proven correct. </p></answer></exercise>

<exercise><statement><p>
        Prove, by mathematical induction, that <m>F_0 + F_1 + F_2 + \cdots + F_{n} = F_{n+2} - 1</m>,
        where <m>F_n</m> is the <m>n</m>th number in the
