<p>Read Section 13.3 of <em>Applied Discrete Structures</em>.  In this section we further restrict our attention to lattices that have the algebraic properties that are required of a Boolean Algebra. Propositional logic that we saw in Chapter 3 is prime model for what Boolean Algebra is like, but there several other concrete Boolean Algebras that we will consider.</p>
<question component="paper"><title>Response Question</title><statement><p>   Why can't a lattice with three elements, a mininum element, a maximum element and third element between them be a boolean algebra?  </p></statement></question>
<p component="paper">Also, turn in solutions to these exercises: 
	<ul><li>Let <m>D_n</m> be the set of positive integers that divide evenly into <m>n</m>.  List the elements of each of the sets <m>D_{6}, D_{16}, D_{12}\textrm{, and }D_{30}</m> </li>
		<li><p>What is the complement of a logical proposition in the Boolean algebra of logic?</p></li>
		</ul>  </p>

<li> <p>Consider the lattices of divisors of 6, 12, 16, and 30, with the partial ordering <q>divides</q>.

<li><p>Determine which elements of <m>D_6</m> have a complement.</p></li>
<li><p>Determine which elements of <m>D_{12}</m> have a complement.</p></li>
<li><p>Determine which elements of <m>D_{16}</m> have a complement.</p></li>
<li><p>Determine which elements of <m>D_{30}</m> have a complement.</p></li>
<li><p>Given that <m>D_n</m> is always a distributive lattice, for what values of <m>n</m> do you suppose <m>D_n</m> is a boolean algebra?</p></li>
</ol>
</p></li>
<li><p>Recall that if <m>[G;*]</m> is a finite group and <m>a \in G</m>,  the cyclic subgroup generated by <m>a</m> is <m>\langle a \rangle=\{a, a*a, a*a*a, \dots\}</m>, which is a finite set since you eventually get to the identity and can stop listing elements.  For example, if the group is <m>\mathbb{Z}_{6}</m>, there are four different cyclic subgroups:  <m>\langle 0 \rangle</m>, <m>\langle 1 \rangle</m>, <m>\langle 2 \rangle</m>, and <m>\langle 3 \rangle</m>.  The other two elements of <m>\mathbb{Z}_{6}</m>, 4 and 5 generate subgroups that are equal to the subgroups generated by 2 and 1, respectively.  The Hasse 
diagram for this set of subgroups with <m>\subseteq</m> is <xref ref="fig-z6-subgroups"/></p>
<p>	<ol>
		<li><p>List the distinct cyclic subgroups generated by elements of <m>\mathbb{Z}_{12}</m>. The set of subgroups you've found is a lattice with the partial ordering <m>\subseteq</m>. Draw the Hasse diagram for this poset.</p></li>
		<li><p>Do the same with the cyclic subgroups generated by elements of <m>\mathbb{Z}_{16}</m>.</p></li>
		<li><p>Do the same with the cyclic subgroups generated by elements of <m>\mathbb{Z}_{30}</m>.</p></li>
		<li><p>Any general observations from the three cases?</p></li>
