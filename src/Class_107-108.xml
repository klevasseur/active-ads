<p>Reread Section 11.1 and read Section 11.2 of <em>Applied Discrete Structures</em>. This is the beginning of a new topic, but you'll find that there are connections between algebra and graph theory.   In this first section we review properties of binary operations.</p>

		<exercise><statement><p>What properties that are introduced in Secton 11.1 are true of intersection on the power set of <m>\{0,1\}</m>?.</p></statement><solution><p></p></solution></exercise>
		<exercise>
		<statement><p>Consider the  operation <m>\square</m> on the  integers defined by  <me>a \square b  = a+b-1.</me>  
	<ol marker="(a)">
		<li><p> Is <m>\square</m> associative?</p></li>
		<li><p>Does  <m>\square</m> have an identity in the positive integers?</p></li>
		<li><p> Does  <m>\square</m> have the inverse property?</p></li>
		</ol></p>
		</statement>
		<solution><p>
		<ol marker="(a)">
		<li><p>Yes, it is associative: 
		<md>
		<mrow>(a \square b)\square c= (a+b-1)\square c = a+b-1+c-1 = a+b+c-2</mrow>
		<mrow>a \square(b \square c)= a \square(b+c-1) = a+(b+c-1)-1 = a+b+c-2</mrow></md></p></li>
		<li><p>If <m>e</m> is an identity,  we would need <m>a \square e=a+e-1 = a.</m>  Solving <m>a+e-1 = a</m> for <m>e</m>, we see that 1 is an identity. </p></li>
		<li><p>No, the inverse of a postitive integer <m>a</m>  would be <m>b</m>   such that <m>a \square b=1</m>.   Therefore <m>a+b-1=1</m>, or <m>b=-a+2</m>.  But since we assume <m>a</m> is a positive integer <m>b</m> is not positive unless <m>a = 1</m>,  and so only 1 have an inverse.</p></li>

		<exercise><statement><p>This question is open-ended, with no specific <q>right</q> answer.  Suppose that <m>V</m> is some finite nonempty set. What would be an example of a binary operation on the set of all undirected graphs with vertex set<m>V</m>?</p>
		</statement><solution><p></p></solution></exercise>
<exercise><statement><p>Let <m>U</m> be a any set.  Prove that, <m>\oplus</m>, defined by <m>A \oplus  B = (A \cup  B) - (A \cap  B)</m> is an associative operation on <m>\mathcal{P}(U)</m>. </p></statement>
</exercise>
<exercise><statement><p>Let <m>U</m> be a any set.  Prove that,   <m>[\mathcal{P}(U); \oplus]</m> is a group. </p></statement>
</exercise>
		<exercise><statement><p>Consider the following set of six  algebraic expressions, each defining a function on the set of real numbers excluding the numbers 0 and 1.  
		<me>\mathcal{H}=\left\{x,1-x,\frac{1}{1-x},\frac{1}{x},\frac{x-1}{x},\frac{x}{x-1}\right\}
				=\left\{y_1,y_2,y_3,y_4,y_5,y_6\right\}</me>
 We can operate on any two of these expressions using function composition.  For example,
 <me>(y_3 \circ y_4)(x) = y_3(y_4(x))=y_3(\frac{1}{x})=\frac{1}{1-\frac{1}{x}}=\frac{x}{x-1}=y_6(x)</me>
 Therefore, <m>y_3 \circ y_4 = y_6</m>.  Complete the following operation table for function composition on <m>\mathcal{H}</m>.</p>

<p>	 Is <m>[\mathcal{H},\circ]</m> a monoid? Is it a group?</p>

		<exercise><statement><p>Let <m>S</m> be the set of all strings of letters of length zero or more from the set <m>\{a,b,c\}</m> that do not have any consecutive identical letters.  Define <m>*</m> on <m>S</m> by the rule that if <m>x, y \in S</m> then <m>x*y</m> is determined by first concatenating  <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> and then repeatedly removing any occurrences of two identical letters until the result is an element of <m>S</m>.   Is <m>[S,*]</m> a monoid?  Is it a group?
