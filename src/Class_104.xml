<p>Read Section 9.4 of <em>Applied Discrete Structures</em>.  In this section, we consider whether certain paths or circuits exist in a given graph.  Our objective will either be to trace every edge once or visit every vertex once.</p>

		<exercise><statement><p>In answering the question <q>Is every Eulerian graph also Hamiltonian?</q> Hansel pointed out an Eulerian circuit in a specific graph that visited several vertices more than once.  He concluded that this graph can't be Hamiltonian since a Hamiltonian circuit visits each vertex exactly once. Therefore, the answer to the question is <q>No!</q> Is his answer correct? Is his reasoning correct?  Explain your answers.</p></statement><solution><p></p></solution></exercise>

		<exercise><statement><p>For each of the following sets of twelve dominos, is it possible to arrange them end-to-end so that touching ends have matching numbers and the numbers at the two ends of the line match?

		 </image></figure></li>
		</ol></p></statement><solution><p>The answers to both parts can be arrived at by realizing that each domino can be thought of as an edge between vertices having the two numbers on the domino.  We are then asking for an Eulerian circuit or path in the corresponding graph.  A circuit exists  for the first set of dominos, but not the second. For the second, the degrees of four vertices are odd and so the dominos cannot be arranged as desired.	</p></solution></exercise>
