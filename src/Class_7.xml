<p>Read sections 3.3 and 3.4 of Applied Discrete Structures. Two propositions may be totally unrelated.  For example, <q>It snowed today.</q> and <q>I played chess today.</q> are likely to be unrelated.  Yet <q>It snowed today.</q> and <q>I played golf today.</q> are two propositions that are related in that it is unlikely that both are true.  In these two sections we introduce the ideas of equivalence and implication, which give us a precise way to talk about how propositions are related.</p>

<exercise><statement><p><!-- Based on a problem from Oscar Levin's book -->
        Frankie Fib was telling you what he consumed yesterday afternoon.
        He tells you, <q>I had either popcorn or raisins.
        Also, if I had cucumber sandwiches, then I had soda.
        But I didn't drink soda or tea.</q>
        Of course you know that Frankie is the worlds worst liar,
        and everything he says is false.
        What did Frankie have to eat and drink?

<exercise><statement><p>Construct the truth table for <m>(p \rightarrow q) \land (q \rightarrow r) \land (r \rightarrow p)</m>.   Notice anything about the result?</p></statement></exercise>

<exercise><statement><p>Suppose that a proposition <m>x</m> generated by <m>p</m>, <m>q</m> and <m>r</m>  has the truth table in <xref ref="tt-class7-1"/>.  How large a set of propositions generated by <m>p</m>, <m>q</m> and <m>r</m> could you possibly compile that all imply <m>x</m> so that none of them are logically equivalent to one another and also not equivalent to <m>x</m>?</p>

<solution component="im"><p>Any proposition satisfying the conditions that are specified must be false in the cases for which <m>x</m> is false. There are 3 cases where <m>x</m> is true, and any proposition we can list can either be true or false for those cases. There are <m>2^3 = 8</m> truth tables that we could construct, but one of them would be equivalent to <m>x</m> so the final answer is 7.</p></solution></exercise>
