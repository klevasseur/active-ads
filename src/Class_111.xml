<p>Read Section 11.5 of <em>Applied Discrete Structures</em>. The main idea is that there are certain subsets of groups that qualify as groups in their own right.  This is an instance of a more general situation in mathematics where a structure can contain smaller structures.  The idea of a subset is the most simple case of this, but we have also seen subgraphs in the study of graphs and trees.  Finding all subgroups of a group isn't always easy, but describing and finding the cyclic subgroups of a group is not too difficult.  Pay close attention how this is done!</p>

		<solution><p>The statement is false because the empty string doesn't start with a 1 and so the identity element is not in the given set. Explain your answer.</p></solution></exercise>
