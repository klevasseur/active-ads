<section xml:id="reading-10"><title>Reading Assignment</title>
<p>Read Sections 3.8 and 3.9 of <em>Applied Discrete Structures</em>.  Quantifiers are used to say something about the truth sets of propositions.  You will read about two basic ones (Universal and Existential).  Individually, they are fairly simple.  Where things can be tricky is when when you have more than one variable and you mix the two types of quantifiers, or you negate a quantified expression.  Pay close attention to these situations. </p>
