<section xml:id="reading-116"><title>Reading Assignment</title>
<p>Read Sections 13.4 and 13.5 of <em>Applied Discrete Structures</em>. For any positive integer, <m>n</m>, the number of different groups of order  <m>n</m> can vary quite a bit. In contrast, the number of Boolean Algebras of order  <m>n</m> is either zero or one. In these two sections, you will see why. </p>
<question><title>Response Question</title><statement><p>  Consider the lattice of real numbers in the interval <m>[0,1]</m> with the relation <m>\leq</m>.  Does this lattice have any atoms? </p></statement></question>
<p>Also, turn in solutions to these exercises: 
	<ul><li><p>What are the atoms of the lattice of subsets of <m>\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\}</m>  generated by the two sets <m>A_1=\{1,3,5,7\}</m> and <m>A_2=\{1,2,3,5\}</m> with the partial ordering <m>\subseteq</m>?</p></li>
		<li><p>What are the atoms of the lattice of positive integers with the relation <q>divides?</q></p></li>
		</ul>  </p>

<li> <p><ol marker="(a)"><li><p>There are many different, yet isomorphic, Boolean algebras with two elements. Describe one such Boolean algebra that is derived from
a power set, <m>\mathcal{P}(A)</m>, under <m>\subseteq</m>. Describe a second that is described from <m>D_n</m>, for some <m>n \in  P</m>, under <q>divides.</q></p></li>
<li><p>  Since the elements of a two-element Boolean algebra must be the greatest and least elements, 1 and 0, the tables for the operations
on <m>\{0, 1\}</m> are determined by the Boolean algebra laws. Write out the operation tables for <m>[\{0, 1\}; \lor , \land, -]</m>.</p></li>
</ol>
</p></li>
<li><p>Consider the Boolean algebra <m>\mathcal{B} = [B_2^6 ; \lor, \land, \- ]</m>, and let <m>E_6</m> be the set of bit strings of length six having an even number of 1's.  Is <m>E_6</m> closed with respect to the operations of <m>\mathcal{B}</m>. </p></li>
<li><p>Give an example of a Boolean algebra of order 16 whose elements are certain subsets of the set <m>\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\}</m>, the minimum element is the empty set, and the maximum element is <m>\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\}</m>.</p></li>
<li><p>Give an example of a Boolean algebra of order 16 whose elements are a certain set of bit strings of the set <m>B_2^7</m>, whose minimum element is <m>0000000</m>, and whose maximum element is <m>1111111</m>.</p></li>
