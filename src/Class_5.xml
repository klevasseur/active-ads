<section xml:id="reading-5"><title>Reading Assignment</title>
<p>Read Sections 2.3 and 2.4 of Applied Discrete Structures. In Section 2.3, you will learn about the Law of Addition, which is another fundamental counting principle.  Finally, we turn to the problem of counting subsets of a set with a fixed size.  The numbers we arrive at happen to be binomial coefficients, which you may have seen in another context, the expansion of an expression like <m>x + y</m> to a power.</p>
<question component="paper"><title>Response Question</title><statement><p>  In mathematics, the word partition is used in two contexts. One is for partitions of sets, as described in Section 2.3. The other is for partitions of a positive integer.  An example of a partition of <m>5</m> is <m>3+1+1</m>, a sum of positive integers equal to <m>5</m>. It is customary to write the terms of the sum in non-increasing order since <m>1+3+1</m> is considered the same partition of <m>5</m>. The other partitions of 5 are <m>5</m>, <m>4+1</m>, <m>3+2</m>, <m>2+2+1</m>, <m>2+1+1+1</m>, and <m>1+1+1+1+1</m>. How might a listing of all partitions of an integer like <m>5</m> help in listing all partitions of a set with that many elements? </p></statement></question>

<exercise><statement><p><idx><h>Lattice Paths</h></idx>The image below shows a 6 by 6 grid and an example of a <term>lattice path</term> that could be taken from <m>(0,0)</m>  to <m>(6,6)</m>, which is a path taken by traveling along grid lines going only to the right and up. How many different lattice paths are there of this type?  Generalize to the case of lattice paths from <m>(0,0)</m> to <m>(m,n)</m>  for any nonnegative integers <m>m</m> and <m>n</m>.</p>

<exercise><statement><p>Consider the set of lattice paths from <m>(0,0)</m> to <m>(8,8)</m>.  You should know one quick formula for the cardinality of that set.  However, counting a different way can lead to an interesting  identity involving binomial coefficients.  Notice that any path goes through exactly one of the points <m>(0,8), (1,7), (2,6), \dots , (8,0)</m>.  Count the number of lattice paths that go through each of those 9 points - leave the expression in terms of binomial coefficients.  Even more interesting is what you get if  generalize to a destination of <m>(n,n)</m>, <m>n \geq 1</m>. </p></statement></exercise>
