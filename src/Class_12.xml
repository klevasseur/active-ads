<p>Read Sections 4.3 and 4.4 of <em>Applied Discrete Structures</em>. Minsets help answer the question of what sets can be created if you start with a certain collection of sets and apply basic set operations to them.   Duality is an organizing principle that set theory shares with logic and a few other mathematical structures.</p>

	 <p>A common way to denote a particular minset generated by a collection of subsets is as follows.  If there are <m>k</m> subsets, <m>B_1, B_2, \dots ,B_k</m>, and <m>b=b_1b_2\cdots b_k</m> is any string of <m>k</m> bits, then 
			<me>M_b =  M_{b_1b_2\cdots b_k} = D_1 \cap D_2 \cap \cdots \cap D_k,</me>
			where <m>D_i</m> is either <m>B_i</m> or <m>B_i^c</m>.  If <m>b_i = 1</m> then <m>D_i =B_i</m> and if <m>b_i=0</m> then <m>D_i=B_i^c</m>.  For example, if <m>k=4</m>, <m>M_{0110} = B_1^c \cap B_2 \cap B_3 \cap B_4^c</m>.

			<li><p>Suppose <m>U=\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}</m>, <m>k=2</m>, <m>B_1= \{1, 2\}</m>, and <m>B_2 = \{2,3,4\}</m>.  List the nonempty minsets generated by <m>B_1</m> and <m>B_2</m> using <q><m>M_b</m></q> notation. Notice that they form a partition of <m>U</m>.</p></li>
			<li><p>How does this notation make help us see how many distinct nonempty minsets there could be that are generated by <m>k</m> subsets of a universe.</p></li>

			<li><p>Partition <m>\{1, 2,  \dots, 8\}</m> into the nonempty minsets generated by <m>B_1= \{1, 2\}</m>, <m>B_2 = \{1, 3, 5, 8\}</m>, and <m>B_3 = \{2, 3, 4, 6\}</m>.</p></li>
			<li><p>How many different subsets of <m>\{1, 2, \dots ,8\}</m> can you create using <m>B_1, B_2</m>, and <m>B_3</m> with the standard set operations?</p></li>
			<li><p>Do there exist subsets <m>C_1, C_2, C_3</m> with which you can generate every subset of <m>\{1,2, . . . ,8\}</m>?  If so, can you find such a collection of subsets?  If not, why?  You might find the Venn diagram below useful for thinking about this problem.</p></li>

<exercise><statement><p>What is the dual of a minset?  These sets are called <q>maxsets</q>  Find the maxsets generated by the two sets in part (a) of the first problem.   Why do you suppose they are called maxsets?</p></statement></exercise>
		
<exercise><statement><p>The descriptions of duality in Section 4.4 is not complete.  If you expand expressions involving subsets, such as the expression <m>A \cap B \subseteq A</m>, which is a true statement in set theory.  What should be the dual?  How should we treat the subset symbol?</p></statement></exercise>
