<p>Read Sections 10.1 and 10.2 of <em>Applied Discrete Structures</em>. In these sections we introduce trees, which are connected graphs without cycles.  We also examine spanning trees of connected graphs, which are the smallest subgraphs which maintain connectedness in a graph.</p>

<p>Prove that the center of any tree can have no more than two vertices.</p>
</statement>
<solution component="im">
<p>If we can prove that any two vertices in the center of a tree must be adjacent, then having three or more vertices in the center would violate the acyclic property of a tree.  </p>
<p>Suppose <m>v_1</m> and <m>v_2</m> belong to the center a tree. Furthermore assume they have eccentricity <m>k</m> and that they are not adjacent; so there is a vertex <m>w</m> l in the path between them.  (Recall that paths between vertices in a tree are unique.) Since the eccentricity of <m>v_1</m> is <m>k</m> there must be a vertex <m>u</m> whose (edge) distance from <m>v_1</m> is <m>k</m>.  The path between them must pass through <m>v_2</m>l for otherwise, the distance from <m>u</m> to <m>v_2</m> would be greater than <m>k</m> which is a contradiction.  This means that the distance from <m>w</m> to <m>u</m> is less than <m>k</m>.  We can apply this logic to any vertex whose disance from either <m>v_i</m> is equal to <m>k</m> and conclude that the eccentricity of <m>w</m> is less than the radius of the tree, which is a contradiction.</p>

        For each degree sequence below, decide whether it must always, must never, or could possibly be a degree sequence for a tree.  If it is always a tree, is the tree unique?  Justify your answers. (Adapted from <xref ref="biblio-levin-2020"/>.)
