<section xml:id="reading-9"><title>Reading Assignment</title>
<p>Read Sections 3.6 and 3.7 of <em>Applied Discrete Structures</em>. It is only necessary to read 3.6 through Example 3.6.7.   The main idea in this reading is Mathematical Induction, which is a proof technique for propositions that have an integer variable.  This type of proof is used throughout mathematics and is particularly prevalent in discrete settings.	</p>
<question><title>Response Question</title><statement><p>  You don’t need induction to prove that the sum of the first <m>n</m> Positive integers equals <m>\frac{n(n+1)}{2}</m>. Google “Gauss sum of consecutive integers” and read about how you can do it even more simply. Explain what you read.  </p></statement></question>
<p>Also, turn in solutions to these exercises.</p>

<exercise><statement><p>Prove that for <m>n \ge 0</m>, <m>\sum_{k=0}^n {2^k} = 2^{n+1}-1</m>.</p></statement>
<solution><p>Let <m>p(n)</m> be the proposition <m>\sum_{k=0}^{n} 2^k = 2^{n+1}-1</m>, <m>n\geq 0</m>.  The basis of an induction proof that this proposition is a tautology is to observe that if <m>n=0</m> we have <m>2^0 = 2^{0+1}-1</m>, which is true.</p>
<p>Now the induction step of the proof calls for assuming that for some <m>n \geq 0</m>, <m>p(n)</m> is true (this is the <q>induction hypothesis</q>).   We then proof that <m>p(n+1)</m> follows from the induction hypothesis.
<me>\begin{split}
	\sum_{k=0}^{n+1} {2^k} &amp;= \sum_{k=0}^n {2^k} +2^{n+1}\\
							&amp;= (2^{n+1}-1) + 2^{n+1} \quad\quad\textrm{by the induction hypothesis}\\
							&amp;= 2^{n+2}-1\\ 
							&amp;= 2^{(n+1)+1}-1
	\end{split}
	</me>
	and we are done!
