 <title>Response Question</title>
 <statement><p>The original version of the computer language BASIC on Apple II computers used 16 bits for an integer, one of which was used to specify the sign of the integer.  What would have been the maximum size of an integer in that language?</p>	</statement><answer component="im"><m>2^{15}-1</m></answer><solution component="im"><p>The maximum would be the integer  with the binary representation of 15 ones, <m>2^{15}-1= 32,767</m>.</p></solution></exercise>
 <exercise><statement><p>Why is the sum of the degrees of the vertices of any undirected graph always even?</p></statement><solution component="im"><p>Each edge contributes two to the sum of degrees.</p></solution></exercise>
 <exercise><statement><p>Demonstrate that <m>(4,3,2,2,1)</m> is a graphic sequence.</p></statement><solution component="im"><p>The most direct solution is to simply draw a graph having <m>(4,3,2,2,1)</m>  as it's degree sequence.  In this case there is essentially only one possible graph.</p>

<li><p>Prove that any undirected graph with at least two vertices must have two vertices of the same degree.</p></li>
<li><p>Starting at vertex <m>s</m>, any finite path in <xref ref="fig-directed-graph-ex1" text="type-global"/> produces a string of bits that are recorded according to the labels on each edge.  For example, the path <m>s,a,b,a,b,b,a</m> will produce the string 101001.</p>				<figure xml:id="fig-directed-graph-ex1">

					<description>A directed graph with three vertices, a start vertex and vertices labeled "a" and "b." For each vertex there are either one or two edges. Edges labeled 1 points to the "a" vertex, representing a state in which only a 0 can be the next bit.  From "a" only a "0 edge" is present, pointing to "b".  From other vertices a 0 edge points to "b." </description>

<p>This graph can produce any bit string that contain no consecutive 1's.   Draw a graph similar to it that can produce any bit string that does not contain more than two consecutive 1's.</p></li>
<li><p>Find two isomorphisms between the following graphs.</p>
