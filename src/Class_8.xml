<p>Read section 3.5 of Applied Discrete Structures.  We can say that there are various relationships between propositions, but it might not be obvious that what we say is really true.  A proof is meant to be a means by which one can be convinced that such a relationship is true. Proofs are central to mathematics and appear in all remaining chapters in this book.  In Section 3.5 we start by identifying two basic types of proof: direct and indirect.</p>
<question component="paper"><title>Response Question</title><statement><p>  A proposition, <m>P</m>, generated by a set of propositional variables is said to be satisfiable if there is at least one way to assign truth values to all of the variables so that <m>P</m> Is true. Explain why <m>P</m> is satisfiable as long as <m>\neg P</m>  is not a tautology. </p></statement></question>

<commentary component="im"><title>Why ask this here?</title> <idx>commentary</idx><p>This problem looks like it belongs in an earlier class.  It might be argued that it's fine that we are revisting older material, but it is actuall placed here to set up the next topic, proof by induction.  When students complete this problem, they should have come up with a closed form expression for the sum of the squares of the first <m>n</m> positive integers. However the logic is just tricky enough that you could argue that whatever is arrived could be flawed.  This is where proof by induction can naturally be introduced!</p></commentary>
<p>There are <m>n+1</m>, <m>n\ge 1</m> people who want to go to a concert.  All have different ages. You have three tickets: a back-stage pass and two regular (but distinguishable) tickets. Here are the rules for passing out the tickets:
    	<ul>
			<li>The backstage pass must go to the oldest person who gets a ticket.</li>
			<li>The person who gets the backstage pass can't get either of the other two tickets, but the two regular tickets can both go to the same person.</li>
		</ul>
		How many ways can you give away the tickets? There are two ways to count. Find both and equate them.</p>

		In these two Lewis Carroll puzzles, you are given premises and are expected to form your own conclusion.  In each of them, convert the premises to symbolic form, draw a conclusion, and then translate back to English.
