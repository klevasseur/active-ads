<p>These exerises are assume you have read Section 9.1 of <em>Applied Discrete Structures</em>. This section introduces some basic terminology and properties of graphs.</p>

	<ul>
		<li><p>Why is the sum of the degrees of the vertices of any undirected graph always even?</p></li>
		<li><p>Demonstrate that <m>(4,3,2,2,1)</m> is a graphic sequence.</p></li>

<li><p>Starting at vertex <m>s</m>, any finite path in <xref ref="fig-directed-graph-ex1" text="type-global"/> produces a string of bits that are recorded according to the labels on each edge.  For example, the path <m>s,a,b,a,b,b,a</m> will produce the string 101001.</p>				<figure xml:id="fig-directed-graph-ex1">

					<description>A directed graph with three vertices, a start vertex and vertices labeled "a" and "b." For each vertex there are either one or two edges. Edges labeled 1 points to the "a" vertex, representing a state in which only a 0 can be the next bit.  From "a" only a "0 edge" is present, pointing to "b".  From other vertices a 0 edge points to "b." </description>

<p>This graph produces bit strings that contain no consecutive 1's.   Draw a graph similar to it that produces bit strings containing no more than two consecutive 1's.</p></li>
