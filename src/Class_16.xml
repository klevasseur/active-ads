<title>Properties of Relations</title>

<section xml:id="reading-16"><title>Reading Assignment</title>
<p>Read Section 6.3 of <em>Applied Discrete Structures</em>.  You will read about four properties that are satisfied by certain relations.  Two combinations of these properties, when true, characterize relations that are particularly important.  They are partial orderings and equivalence relations. Make an effort to memorize the terms in this section - they will appear throughout the rest of the book.</p>

<exercise><statement><p>Let <m>A</m> be the set of strings of 0's and 1's of length 3 or less; and let <m>B</m> be the set of strings of 0's and 1's of length 3. What properties do the following relations have? 
			<ol marker="(a)"><li>Define the relation of <m>w</m> on <m>A</m> by <m>x w y</m> if <m>x</m> has the same number of 1's as <m>y</m>. For example, <m>01 w 100</m>, but <m>01 w 101</m> is false. </li>
			<li>Define the the relation <m>d</m>  on <m>B</m> defined by <m>x d y</m> if <m>x</m> differs from <m>y</m> in exactly one position. For example, <m>100 d 101</m>, but <m>100 d 111</m> is false.</li>
			<li>Define the the relation <m>c</m> defined  on <m>A</m> by <m>x c y</m> if <m>x</m> is contained within <m>y</m>. For example, <m>10 c 101</m>, but <m>11 c 101</m> is false.</li>

	For any of these relations that are partial orderings, draw the Hasse diagram for that relation.  For any of them that is an equivalence relation, identify the equivalence classes.</p></statement></exercise>
