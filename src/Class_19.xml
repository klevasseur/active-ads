<section xml:id="reading-19"><title>Reading Assignment</title>
<p>Read Section 7.3 of <em>Applied Discrete Structures</em>.  The key concept in this section is function composition, which is fundamental in mathematics and computer science. Be sure to learn how it works and you'll be in good shape for the rest of the book!</p>

<exercise><statement><p> Let <m>A = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}</m>. Define <m>f:A\rightarrow A</m> by <m>f(1) = 2</m>, <m>f(2) = 3</m>, <m>f(3) = 4</m>, and <m>f(4) = 1</m>. Find <m>f^2</m>, <m>f^3</m>, <m>f^4</m> and <m>f^{-1}</m>.  You can describe each of these functions as being equal to a previous one, or in the same manner as <m>f</m> was originally described.</p></statement></exercise>

<exercise><statement><p>Prove that if a function has an inverse, that inverse must be unique.</p></statement></exercise>

<exercise><statement><p> Let <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> be functions whose inverses exist. Prove that <m>(f\circ g)^{-1}= g^{-1}\circ f^{-1}</m>.</p></statement></exercise>

<exercise><statement><p><ol marker="(a)"><li> Our definition of cardinality states that two sets, <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>, have the same cardinality if there exists a bijection
between the two sets. Why does it not matter whether the bijection is from <m>A</m> into <m>B</m> or <m>B</m> into <m>A</m>?</li>
<li><p>Prove that <q>has the same cardinality as</q> is an equivalence relation on sets.</p></li>
