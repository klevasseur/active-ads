<p>Read Sections 7.1 and 7.2 of <em>Applied Discrete Structures</em>.  You may think you know about functions if you've taken calculus, but the approach to functions in Chapter 7, which is the more formal approach, is different. So make an effort to memorize the terms!  The good news is that there are only two key properties that are introduced in Section 7.2.</p>
<question component="paper"><title>Response Question</title><statement><p>  In programming, a <em>function</em> is a named section of a program that performs a specific task and returns a value.  How does this compare with the definition of a function in mathematics?    </p></statement></question>

<exercise><statement><p>Infinite Acres Spa and Math Camp has an infinite number of single occupancy rooms, numbered with each positive integer.  You are the night manager.  The spa is fully booked for the weekend and all rooms are occupied. A bus arrives late Friday night.  You find that the manager has booked an additional infinite busload of customers, with confirmation codes numbered <m>1, 2, 3, \dots</m>.   Can you accomodate the new arrivals? </p></statement></exercise>
