<question><title>Response Question</title><statement><p>  In most applications to graph theory, the graphs are really too large to draw. One only imagines the graph. For example, imagine a graph representing the residents of a city of 100,000, with an edge between any two persons who live within 50  m. of one another.  Estimate the number of vertices you might have.  If you wanted to draw the graph, estimate how large a  square piece of paper you would need if the vertices were 1 mm. in radius.  </p></statement></question>

<question component="paper"><title>Response Question</title><statement><p>  You're certainly more familiar with the terms diameter, radius and center as they pertain to circles.  Compare their use for circles with their use in graph theory.   How are they similar and how are they different?    </p></statement></question>

<exercise xml:id="class-grid-problem"><statement><p>A classroom has 5 rows of desks, with 7 desks in each row.   Suppose we want to represent this rectangular arrangement of desks in an undirected graph, where each desk is connected to the neighboring desks to it's front, back, left and right.  Of course, some desks have fewer than four neighbors.

	  	<li><p>How many edges will the graph have?</p></li>

	  	<li><p>If an adjacency matrix is constructed for this graph with one bit (0/1) for each entry, how many bits would be needed?  Assume we only store the part of the matrix that appears to the top right of the main diagonal of the matrix since its symmetric.</p></li>
