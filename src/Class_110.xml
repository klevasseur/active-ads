<p>Read Section 11.4 of <em>Applied Discrete Structures</em>. When you get to Investigation 11.4.1, skip down to Section 11.4.3 Modular Arithmetic. </p>
<p> The definitions of modular addition and multiplication in this section are <em>really important</em>.  They are used throughout the rest of the book.  The section starts with a review of division properties for integers in order to set up the modular operations.  Generally, the mod <m>n</m> operations are operations only on either <m>\mathbb{Z}_n</m>, or a subset of <m>\mathbb{Z}_n</m>.  For example, it wouldn't make sense to do mod 10 addition on <m>Z_{12}</m>.</p>

<p>Also, turn in solutions to the following exercises.  Both of them could be done using SageMath by typing two short inputs, but you are encouraged to write (or type) both of these be hand.</p>

		<exercise><statement><p>Let <m>n</m> be a positive integer greater than 1.  Show that <m>n-1</m> has a multiplicative inverse mod <m>n</m>. </p></statement>
		<solution><p>Since <m>gcd(n,n-1)=gcd(n-1,1)=1</m>, <m>n-1</m> has a mod <m>n</m> inverse.  In fact, it is its own inverse.</p></solution></exercise>
