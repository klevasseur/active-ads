<p>Read Section 11.4 of <em>Applied Discrete Structures</em>. When you get to Investigation 11.4.1, skip down to Section 11.4.3 Modular Arithmetic. </p>
<p> The definitions of modular addition and multiplication in this section are <em>really important</em>.  They are used throughout the rest of the book.  The section starts with a review of division properties for integers in order to set up the modular operations.  Generally, the mod <m>n</m> operations are operations only on either <m>\mathbb{Z}_n</m>, or a subset of <m>\mathbb{Z}_n</m>.  For example, it wouldn't make sense to do mod 10 addition on <m>Z_{12}</m>.</p>

		<exercise><statement><p>Let <m>n</m> be a positive integer greater than 1.  Show that <m>n-1</m> has a multiplicative inverse mod <m>n</m>. </p></statement>
		<solution><p>Since <m>gcd(n,n-1)=gcd(n-1,1)=1</m>, <m>n-1</m> has a mod <m>n</m> inverse.  In fact, it is its own inverse.</p></solution></exercise>
